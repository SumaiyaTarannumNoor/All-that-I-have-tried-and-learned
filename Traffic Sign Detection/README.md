This project was taken from Venelin Velcov's "Transfer Learning for Image Classification with PyTorch & Python Tutorial | Traffic Sign Recognition". </br>
The YouTube link for the project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYlVOrbV_KY&t=3003s </br>
The dataset contains **43 classes** of traffic signs and Venelin has used **ResNet34** for transfer learning. </br>
We have tried to use some of the traffic signs for the classification purpose. </br>
The used traffic signs are: __Give way, No entry, Priority road and Stop__. </br>
We have used **__Resnet50__ and __ResNet34__** for our purpose. </br>
We have used this as a project for our **__CSE465-Pattern Recognition Course__** (Neural Network and Deep Learning) which is associated with **North South University**. </br> 
This project has two more contributors- **Mastura Sadaf** and **Taufiq Ahmed Noor**.
