#This project was taken from Venelin Velcov's "Transfer Learning for Image Classification with PyTorch & Python Tutorial | Traffic Sign Recognition".
##The YouTube link for the project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYlVOrbV_KY&t=3003s
###The dataset contains **43 classes** of traffic signsand have used **ResNet34** for transfer learning.
#We have tried to use some of the traffic signs for the classification purpose.
#The used traffic signs are: __Give way, No entry, Priority road and stop__.
#We have used **__Resnet50__ and __ResNet34__** for our purpose.
