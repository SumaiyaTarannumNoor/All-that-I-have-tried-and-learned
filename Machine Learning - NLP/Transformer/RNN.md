# RNN
**Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** differ from regular neural networks in how they process information. While standard neural networks pass information in one direction 
i.e from input to output, RNNs feed information back into the network at each step.

Imagine reading a sentence and you try to predict the next word, you don’t rely only on the current word but also remember the words that came before. RNNs work similarly by
“remembering” past information and passing the output from one step as input to the next i.e it considers all the earlier words to choose the most likely next word. This memory
of previous steps helps the network understand context and make better predictions.
