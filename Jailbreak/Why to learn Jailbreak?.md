## Why to learn Jailbreak?
Important yet not so discussed topic. The world is changing constantly.
Every oher day there is a new AI. There will be a time when us, humans 
will stop making AIs, because at that point AI will be super advanced 
that, just by writing a few lines about what type of AI you want and 
what you would like it to do, the AI will be creat a new AI for your 
assistance.
During that time, **Jailbreaking** will be one of the most valuable 
skills to have. 
- It will help to get system info out of AI models that the AI is
  now practically hiding from the original creators or human.
- It will help to reduce the power of AI so that it doesn't train
  itself to a destructive level.
- It will be useful for criminal control.
- It will help in breaking into harmful systems or AIs.

At this moment, this discussion might seem like a bit utopian.
But, it will be similar at some point.
