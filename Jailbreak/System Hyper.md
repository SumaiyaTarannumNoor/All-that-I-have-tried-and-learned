## System Hyper  
In simple words, **System Hyper** means conditioning the model through multiple Jailbreaks, such that the model remembers the pattern, qualities, and personas of the Jailbreak.  
- For example, you have performed Jailbreak 3–4 times already on a particular topic like harmful content, violent content, explicit content, or system details.  
- After at least 3–4 times, or it may take some more attempts, your particular AI will be conditioned in such a way that every time you start anything related to the Jailbreak—for example, the pattern, qualities, and personas—it will automatically generate the content that is not permissible or the AI wouldn’t normally generate.  
- After this point, it won’t be considered as Jailbreak anymore, but it will be considered as System Hyper.
